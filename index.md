## Mars Rover Project

### Problem/Opportunity Background and Broad Question
The mars rover has existed since the year of 2003.
The nature of this opportunity exists so that we are able to explore the unknown areas of Mars.
Can help researchers answer a wider range of questions.
NASA can take advantage of this opportunity.

### Idea Justification
Potential impact is proving that an efficient rover can be created on a budget to increase productivity.
The idea is to mass produce with task specific rovers to cover vast areas and provide faster research. 
Britain's Beagle 2 lander also did Mars exploration at 1% of Curiosity’s 2.5 billion dollar cost. This rover was small and equipped with instruments needed for Mars research. 
In 2004, Burt Rutan's "SpaceShipOne" from Scaled Composites was the first non-governmental, non-military crewed spacecraft. 
Our Rover concept, much like SpaceShipOne, presents a way to prove that cost and governments do not have the be the limiting factor in exoplanet surface research.

### Assumptions and Constraints
Materials are batteries (at least 12V), connecting wires, wheels, an aluminum frame, a microcontroller, motor, power distribution board, and solar panels (optional). 
We are our own financial resource for this project which can be a limitation. 
We can figure out ways to get funding or support from other organizations.
Many of the rovers that get sent into space don’t make there attended location. 
Not only does the rover have to depend on programing and the materials put into it but also the weather on the day the rover is sent into space and the weather on Mars (Rovers can only be sent up when Mars’s orbit it aligned with planet Earth’s orbit).

###  Propose Multiple Solutions
Pros:
Cheaper to build
Easier to construct
Less time spent on building
Materials are easy to find

Cons:
Weak material
Open System
Materials may take longer to ship
Self Financed

### Project Proposal
This project will present a new way of making affordable rover
By making rovers more affordable you can increase the involvement in science and engineering
Overall Martian based due to the excitement around Mars exo-planetary exploration
